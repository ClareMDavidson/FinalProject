    My name is Nessa and a few months ago I moved into a gorgeous new flat in a very cool converted old building.
    I was over the moon, but since then all I've had is trouble.
    <br><br>
    I discovered that the place was actually an old asylum with a really murky history and I'm not sure that everything that happened here is staying in the past.
    I've started this blog to document the strange things going on in my flat- not just as evidence that I'm really not insane but
    also to ask for advice. 
    <br><br>
    I'm a woman on the edge and I need all the help I can get. You won't have to read many of my posts to see what I mean.
